- Training Extra (SPs) -

Purpose:
The "Training Extra (SPs)" folder contains system prompts that expand the AI’s knowledge and rules using structured data and metadata.

Versions:
Base versions (V1, V2, etc.) include the full, uncompressed content and serve as reference versions.

Optimized versions:
SC (Short Code) – Frequently used terms are replaced with short codes to reduce size while keeping all information intact. SC provides moderate compression.
TM (Token Mapping) – Terms and structures are mapped to tokens for dense storage and maximum compression. TM currently achieves the strongest size reduction.
